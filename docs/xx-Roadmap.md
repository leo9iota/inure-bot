# Roadmap

## Current Project Status

My project, Inure Bot, is a crypto trading and signaling bot with Telegram integration. Here's what you've already implemented:

### Backend

- Basic FastAPI setup with database connection (PostgreSQL)
- Database models for User, TradingBot, and Trade
- Basic API endpoints (root, health check, users)
- Base classes for signal providers and trading strategies
- Telegram integration skeleton

### Frontend

Plan to use React, TypeScript, React Router v7, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI

## Next Steps

1. Complete Backend API Development
   Implement authentication system (JWT)
   Create CRUD endpoints for TradingBot and Trade models
   Implement signal generation and processing logic
   Connect to cryptocurrency data sources
2. Start Frontend Development
   Set up React with TypeScript project structure
   Implement basic UI components with Tailwind and Shadcn
   Create authentication pages (login/register)
   Build dashboard for monitoring trading bots and signals
3. Implement Telegram Bot Integration
   Complete the Telegram bot implementation
   Set up signal notification system
   Implement user commands for bot control
4. Develop Trading Strategies
   Implement concrete trading strategy classes
   Add backtesting capabilities
   Create strategy configuration system
5. Enhance Testing and Documentation
   Add more comprehensive tests for all components
   Complete API documentation
   Add user documentation
   Where to Start Working
   Based on your project's current state, I recommend focusing on the following areas first:

## Examples

Backend: Authentication System
This is a critical component that will be needed for both the API and frontend. Implementing this first will allow you to build secure API endpoints and the frontend authentication flow.

Backend: Complete API Endpoints
Implementing the remaining CRUD operations for your models will provide the foundation for your frontend to interact with the backend.

Frontend: Basic Setup and Authentication UI
Setting up the frontend project structure and implementing the authentication UI will allow you to start building the user interface for your application.
